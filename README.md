# Fuel-Efficiency-prediction-
This project focuses on predicting vehicle fuel efficiency (km/l) using machine learning techniques. 
The goal is to build accurate predictive models through advanced feature engineering and ensemble methods to optimize fuel consumption predictions.

# Challenge Description
The hackathon challenge involved developing models that can predict fuel efficiency based on various vehicle attributes and environmental factors. 
Effectiveness was measured using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric, aiming to minimize prediction error.

# Data Description
The dataset includes multiple vehicle features such as fuel category, owner count, car brand, transmission type, and other relevant parameters.
Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.

# Methodology
Extensive feature engineering was applied to extract meaningful predictors.
Multiple models were trained, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ensemble techniques.
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were used to improve model performance.
Model evaluation was performed using RMSE on validation datasets.

# Results
The final ensemble model achieved an RMSE of approximately 5.45, showing competitive prediction accuracy.
Iterative improvements and error analysis helped fine-tune model effectiveness.

# Usage
Instructions on running the models and reproducing the results.
